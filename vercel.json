### 2. How to Proceed (Updated Steps)

Now that the file is fixed, let's push this fix to GitHub and re-deploy.

#### **Task 1: Push the Fix to GitHub**

You are already in your main project folder `edusphere-project (main)`.

1.  **Add the file change:**
    ```bash
    git add vercel.json
    ```
2.  **Commit the fix:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "FIX: Simplify vercel.json for Vercel deployment"
    ```
3.  **Push to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

#### **Task 2: Re-Deploy on Vercel (The Clean Way)**

Let's delete the broken project on Vercel and import the new, fixed version.

1.  **Delete Old Project:**
    * Go to your Vercel Dashboard.
    * Click on the `edusphere` project.
    * Go to the **"Settings"** tab.
    * Scroll to the very bottom and **"Delete Project"**.

2.  **Re-Import Project:**
    * Go back to your dashboard, click **"Add New..."** -> **"Project"**.
    * Import your `edusphere-project` from GitHub again.

3.  **Configure Project (New Instructions):**
    You are now on the "Configure Project" screen.

    * **Root Directory:**
        * Click "Edit" and set this to **`client`**. (This is the same as before).
        * The "Framework Preset" will become **"Vite"**. This is correct.

    * **Build and Output Settings:**
        * Click to expand this section.
        * Find the **"Install Command"** field. 
        * In the text box, paste this command:
            ```
            npm install --legacy-peer-deps
